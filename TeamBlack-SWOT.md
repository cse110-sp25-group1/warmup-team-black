# Blackjack Web Project â€“ Review and Reflection

## Review of the Process

Our Blackjack web game development followed a practical and iterative workflow. We started by establishing a visual layout using HTML and CSS and then incrementally built game logic using JavaScript. At first, we had working game logic in a procedural style, then compared it to a modular version developed by another team. While the base game worked, we faced key decisions like represent card assets, manage game states, and how to integrate the pieces together. Eventually, we merged the logic with the visual layout and UI interactions, ensuring the cards, user inputs, and results displayed properly. This merging process helped us practice communication between frontend and backend code responsibilities and strengthened our understanding of DOM manipulation, game state control, and modularity.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
- We have members who are capable of coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The team was enthusiastic, proactive, and consistently gave updates.
- We had working prototypes early, which allowed time for debugging and refinement.

### Weaknesses:
- Some of us were unfamiliar with web development concepts.
- Initial backend/frontend logic was not aligned, which slowed integration.

### Opportunities:
- The project gave all members a chance to explore and find their areas of interest (e.g., frontend, game logic, or UI).
- There was continuous growth in communication and debugging skills throughout development.
- Exposure to modular design and real-world integration between logic and UI opened doors for scaling future projects.

### Threats:
- Code reviews and file integration between frontend and backend were a challenge without a clear versioning strategy.
- Time management became tight when debugging issues or realigning mismatched code.
